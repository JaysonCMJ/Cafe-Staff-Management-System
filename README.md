# Cafe-Staff-Management-System Prototype

<h2>Description</h2>
This project was developed as part of my time in university, We designed and developed a Cafe Staff Management System prototype to help streamline workforce management for cafes, supporting a variety of roles such as bidding for work slots and approving work slots. We also utilized an Agile development methodology throughout to simulated working in such an environment.
